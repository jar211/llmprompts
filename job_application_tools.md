# Job Application LLM Tools
## Purpose
This document provides prompts to use with LLMs to understand roles, customize resumes, and customize cover letters.

## Problem
Getting seen through resume submission requires you to get past Applicant Tracking System (ATS) automated keyword systems and then past a recruiter or HR person to the hiring manager. The role has specific requirements and you need to tailor your resume to get past the ATS, through the recruiter, and into the hands of the hiring manager. This is time consuming, especially if you're aggressively searching for work, submitting 10 or more resumes a day. You are up against hundreds or even thousands of candidates for a role. You need to closely match your resume with the requirements of the role to have the best chance.

## Solution
Leverage LLMs to understand if the role is a fit, customize your resume, and customize your cover letter. You may also want to send an introductory message via LinkedIn or email to try to get attention outside of the normal application process.
